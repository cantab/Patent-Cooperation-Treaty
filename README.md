PCT-Receiving-Offices
=====================

List of Receiving Offices of the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

The most up-to-date list of Receiving Offices may be found in the PCT Fee Table section of the latest PCT Newsletter, at http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/ (it is difficult to extract this data into plain text, hence this list).

The list of PCT Receiving Offices is NOT the same as the list of PCT Contracting States.

For one, Patent Offices of regional treaty organisations, such as the European Patent Office, ARIPO, AIPO and the Eurasian Patent Office are NOT Contracting States of the PCT as such. Some of them do, however, act as Receiving Offices, typically for national and residents of their Contracting States.

A further example is the International Bureau of WIPO itself. The IB is a Receiving Office, but neither it nor WIPO is a  Contracting State of the PCT.

Furthermore, not all patent offices of PCT Contracting States act as Receiving Offices. For example, the United Arab Emirates (AE) is a PCT Contracting State, but the patent office of the UAE is not a Receiving Office (PCT applications by UAE nationals/residents are filed at the International Bureau of WIPO).
