<h2>PCT-Receiving-Offices</h2>

<p>This is a list of Receiving Offices of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, in editable form. This list is surprisingly difficult to obtain from official sources. Even WIPO was unable to give me a list of Receiving Offices of the PCT.</p>

<p>The most up-to-date list of Receiving Offices may be found in the PCT Fee Table section of the latest <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/newslett/">PCT Newsletter</a>. The <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/index.jsp">PCT Applicant's Guide</a> also indicates, for each Office of a Contracting State or Regional Organisation, whether it acts as a Receiving Office.</p>

<p>However, it is quite difficult to extract a list of Offices which are Receiving Offices from these sources. We hope you will find the text file simply listing the names of the Receiving Offices will be useful.</p>

<p>The list of PCT Receiving Offices is NOT the same as the list of <a href="https://github.com/Cantab/Patent-Cooperation-Treaty#pct-contracting-states">PCT Contracting States</a>.</p>

<p>For one, Patent Offices of regional treaty organisations, such as the European Patent Office, ARIPO, AIPO and the Eurasian Patent Office are NOT Contracting States of the PCT as such. Some of them do, however, act as Receiving Offices, typically for national and residents of their Contracting States.</p>

<p>A further example is the International Bureau of WIPO itself. The IB is a Receiving Office, but neither it nor WIPO is a Contracting State of the PCT.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not all patent offices of PCT Contracting States act as Receiving Offices. For example, the United Arab Emirates (AE) is a PCT Contracting State, but the patent office of the UAE is not a Receiving Office (PCT applications by UAE nationals/residents are filed at the International Bureau of WIPO).</p>

<p>For an example of how this list may be used, please see the <a href="http://www.cantab-ip.com/singaporenationalphase.html">Cantab LLP PCT Singapore National Phase Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>PCT-Receiving-Offices-ISO</h2>

<p>As above, but countries set out as two letter ISO codes.</p>
